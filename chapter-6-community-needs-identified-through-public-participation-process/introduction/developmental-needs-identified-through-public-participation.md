# Developmental Needs Identified Through Public Participation

Experience with public participation processes is that needs identified often are repeated on an annual basis as not all needs can be addressed due to budgetary constraints. To ensure that a comprehensive overview of the needs of the communities are being captured, a spreadsheet was developed with a “drop-down” function to ensure that the needs can be filtered. During the next review process, this overview of needs will be prioritised. It needs to be emphasized that the needs of the municipality are also captured in this list.

Due to the scale of the spreadsheet, a link is provided as to ensure that the correct format of the document is preserved as to enable the reader to filter the information:
