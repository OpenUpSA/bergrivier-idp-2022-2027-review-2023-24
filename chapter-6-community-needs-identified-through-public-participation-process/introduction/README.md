# Introduction

As stated in Chapter 5, a thorough process has been followed over the last financial years to identify the needs as expressed by the communities in Bergrivier. This is predominantly done through regular ward committee meetings, with specific reference to the ward committee meetings in September of each financial year. The public participation process is further enhanced through public meetings in each town on a bi-annual basis following the ward committee meetings as to ensure that members of the public have equal and open access to providing inputs. The bi-annual IDP Forums also provide a platform for inputs.

Another important process of consultation is contained in the strategic planning session of Council on an annual basis. The Council of Bergrivier conducts on an annual basis a strategic session as to ensure that political direction and mandate is given to the administration in the implementation of the IDP.
