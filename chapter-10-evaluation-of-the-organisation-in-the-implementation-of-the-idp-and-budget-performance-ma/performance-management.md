# Performance Management

The purpose of the Performance Management System in Bergrivier Municipality is to provide a comprehensive plan to help the municipality to manage the process of performance planning and measurement effectively. It serves as a primary mechanism to monitor, review and improve the implementation of the IDP.

The core of the organisational performance management system is the SDBIP (Service Delivery and Budget Implementation Plan). It serves as the source of holding administration, especially management, responsible and accountable for performance. A well formulated SDBIP will ensure that the strategic and correct information is circulated within the municipality and for the public. The Key Performance Indicators contained in the SDBIP must ensure that the budget is executed and the strategic objectives in the IDP are achieved. It also provides a management tool for the mayor and council to monitor the performance of the municipal manager and senior management.

The SDBIP sets in-year information such as quarterly and/or annual service delivery and monthly budget targets. The SDBIP is a layered plan comprising a Top Layer SDBIP and Departmental SDBIP’s. The Top Layer SDBIP comprises quarterly and annual high-level key performance indicators and service delivery targets and is a public document. Performance reporting on the top layer SDBIP is done to the Mayoral Committee and Council on a quarterly, half yearly (Mid-year Budget and Performance Assessment Report) and annual basis (Annual Report). Any amendments to the Top Layer SDBIP must be approved by Council following the submission of the Mid-year Budget and Performance Assessment Report and the approval of the adjustment budget.

Departmental SDBIP’s are informed by the Top Layer SDBIP and contain operational detail on the performance targets of each directorate. Departmental SDBIP’s are used by Portfolio Heads and the Senior Management of the administration to monitor performance of individuals and departments monthly. Monthly performance reports are submitted to the Portfolio Committee assigned to each Department after which these reports are noted by the Executive Mayoral Committee and Council. Amendments to Departmental SDBIPs are done on approval by the Municipal Manager.

The components of the SDBIP are:

* Monthly projections of revenue to be collected, by source;
* Monthly projections of expenditure (operational and capital) by vote;
* Quarterly projections of service delivery targets and performance indicators for each vote;
* Detailed capital works per ward.

Bergrivier Municipality developed a Performance Management Policy in 2019 that sets out the detail of the SDBIP and the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder. This policy will be reviewed in 2024 to make provision for the new Staff Regulations determining the individual performance of all staff in the municipality.

Section 38 (a) of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, No. 32 of 2000, requires Municipalities to set appropriate key performance indicators as a yardstick for measuring performance, including outcomes and impact, regarding the community development priorities and objectives set out in its Integrated Development Plan (IDP). Section 9(1) of the Municipal Planning and Performance Management Regulations to this Act maintains in this regard, that a Municipality must set key performance indicators, including input indicators, output indicators and outcome indicators in respect of each of the development priorities and objectives.

The IDP process and the performance management process must be integrated seamlessly as the Performance Management System serves to measure the performance of the Municipality on meeting its development objectives is contained in its Integrated Development Plan. The IDP will therefore contain outcome based Key Performance Indicators whereas the TL SDBIP will contain output based Key Performance Indicators. A first set of Outcomes Based KPI’s are included in the amended IDP as to commence with the piloting of performance management of the IDP and will serve as the corporate scorecard.

The following table is an overview of the reporting annually in terms of performance management:
