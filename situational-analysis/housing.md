Housing is a concurrent National and Provincial competency in terms Part A of Schedule 4 of the Constitution. Section 10 of the Housing Act, 1997 (Act 107 of 1997) sets out the responsibilities of municipalities in relation to the provision of housing. Housing is included in this section as a basic service as there is a direct correlation between the provision of basic services and housing. This correlation makes it a complex function that relies on high levels of cooperation between the Municipality and the Provincial and National Departments responsible for Housing. However, it needs to be emphasized that the municipality is only the implementing agent regarding housing and the management thereof. The table below provides an overview of these roles and responsibilities.
