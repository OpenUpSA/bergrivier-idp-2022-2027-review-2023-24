# Provincial Planning Framework

## PROVINCIAL STRATEGIC PLAN (2019 – 2024)

The Provincial Strategic Plan (PSP) sets out the Western Cape Government’s (WCG) vision and strategic priorities. The PSP 2019-2024 builds on the firm foundations that were put in place during the last two terms of office and entails the following:

## ONE CAPE 2040

The One Cape 2040 is the Western Cape’s agenda for joint action on economic development. Like the National Development Plan (NDP), it should be viewed as a vision and strategy for society, rather than a plan of government, even though all three spheres of government are essential for implementation. One Cape 2040 is designed to complement national planning while homing in on the regional uniqueness of the Western Cape. It aligns many of the conclusions of the National Development Plan but has a narrower regional focus.

The One Cape 2040 challenge is;

_“Creating a resilient, inclusive and competitive Western Cape with higher rates of employment, producing growing incomes, greater equality and an improved quality of life”._

The One Cape 2040 vision is;

_“A highly skilled, innovation-driven, resource-efficient, connected, high opportunity and collaborative society”._

One Cape 2040 identifies six transition areas with goals and primary change levers.

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Transition</th><th>Goals</th><th>Primary Change Lever</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Knowledge transition (Educating Cape)</td><td><ul><li>Every person will have access to a good education that will ensure he or she is appropriately skilled for opportunity.</li><li>The Western Cape will enjoy a global reputation as a location of ecological, creative, scientific and social innovation excellence.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Working with parents and teachers to improve the learning and development environment of children.</li><li>Structured innovation networks linking researchers with investors and entrepreneurs.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Economic access transition (Enterprising Cape)</td><td><ul><li>Any person who wants to be economically active can secure work.</li><li>The Western Cape is recognised internationally as an entrepreneurial destination of choice.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Intensive subsidised work experience creation supplemented by job intermediation services.</li><li>Focus on social enterprise as a vehicle for economic growth and jobs.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Ecological transition (Green Cape)</td><td><ul><li>All people have access to water, energy and waste services that are delivered on a sustainable resource-efficient manner.</li><li>The Western Cape is a recognised leader and innovator in the green economy.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Energy and water infrastructure and regulation geared to sustainable resource use.</li><li>Focus on social enterprise as a vehicle for economic growth and jobs.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Cultural transition (Connecting Cape)</td><td><ul><li>The communities that make up the Western Cape are confident, welcoming, inclusive and integrated.</li><li>The Western Cape is regarded as a global meeting point between East and West and an important connector with the new markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Programmes to build inter-community partnerships and cohesion.</li><li>Expanded cultural and trade ties with targeted regions in Africa, Latin America and Asia.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Settlement transition (Living Cape)</td><td><ul><li>The neighbourhoods and towns of the region are provided good quality of life to all and are accessible, have good public services and are rich in opportunity.</li><li>The Western Cape is ranked as one of greatest places to live in the world.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Shift from provision of subsidised housing to better household and community services including major improvement in public transport and pedestrian access.</li><li>Fast, cheap and reliable broadband and a safe living environment.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Institutional transition (Leading Cape)</td><td><ul><li>Ambitious socially responsible leadership exists at all levels in our society.</li><li><p>The Western Cape is home to many world- class institutions in both the public and</p><p>private spheres.</p></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Multi-level collaborations for innovation (EDP eco-system).</li><li>Leadership development to cultivate ambition and responsibility at all levels.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

## PROVINCIAL SPATIAL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK (PSDF)

The purpose of the PSDF is inter alia to guide municipal integrated development plans (IDPs) and spatial development frameworks (SDFs). The PSDF aligns to the core spatial goals of ONE CAPE. The PDSF identified 3 main areas of intervention which are subdivided into 9 objectives, each with its own action plans and policies. The following table provides an overview of the intervention areas and objectives of the PSDF.

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Intervention Areas</th><th>Objectives</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Socio economic development</td><td><ol><li>Align the future settlement pattern of the Province with areas of economic potential and the location of environmental resources.</li><li>Deliver human development programmes and basic needs programmes wherever they are required.</li><li>Strategically invest scarce public resources where they will generate the highest socio-economic returns.</li><li>Support land reform. </li><li>Conserve and strengthen the sense of place of important natural, cultural and productive landscapes, artefacts and buildings.</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td>Urban restructuring</td><td><ol start="6"><li>End the apartheid structure of urban settlements.</li><li>Conveniently locate urban activities and promote public and non-motorized transport.</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td>Environmental sustainability</td><td><ol start="8"><li>Protect biodiversity and agricultural resources.</li><li>Minimize the consumption of scarce environmental resources particularly water, fuel, building materials, mineral resources, electricity and land.</li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table>
