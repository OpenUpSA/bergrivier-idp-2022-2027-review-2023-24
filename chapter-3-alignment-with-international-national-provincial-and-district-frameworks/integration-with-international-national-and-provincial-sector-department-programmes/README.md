# Integration With International, National and Provincial Sector Department Programmes

The IDP process aims to identify and prioritise community and municipal needs and integrate them into a singular local level plan which indicates how resources will be allocated to addressing these needs over the cycle of the IDP. The IDP therefore also acknowledges and identifies critical development needs which fall within the functional mandate of the West Coast District Municipality, Western Cape Provincial Government and National Government Departments (and their Public Entities) and indicates how these needs will be addressed in the short, medium and long term (where information is available) by all involved and how they align to municipal planning.

This IDP aligns to Global, National, Provincial and District Planning Frameworks, the most significant being the following:
