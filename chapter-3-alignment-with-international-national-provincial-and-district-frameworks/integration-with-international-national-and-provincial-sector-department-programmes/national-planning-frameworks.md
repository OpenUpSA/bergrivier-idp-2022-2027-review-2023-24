# National Planning Frameworks

The following paragraphs provide an overview of the National Planning Framework that this IDP aligns to.

## NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN: VISION 2030

The National Development Plan: Vision 2030 (NDP) is a long-term plan for the nation which was released in November 2011, and which focuses on “writing a new story for South Africa”. The NDP was preceded by the National Planning Commission’s Diagnostic Report which was released in June 2011, and which set out South Africa’s achievements and shortcomings since 1994. It identified a failure to implement policies and an absence of broad partnerships as the main reasons for slow progress, and set out nine primary challenges:

1. Too few people work;
2. The quality of school education for black people is poor;
3. Infrastructure is poorly located, inadequate and under-maintained;
4. Spatial divides hinders inclusive development;
5. The economy is unsustainably resource intensive;
6. The public health system cannot meet demand or sustain quality;
7. &#x20;Public services are uneven and often of poor quality;
8. Corruption levels are high; and
9. South Africa remains a divided society.

The NDP focuses on reducing poverty and inequality by putting in place the basic requirements that people need, to take advantage of available opportunities. The plan prioritises increasing employment and improving the quality of education while advocating an integrated approach to addressing these challenges. The NDP is divided into 15 Chapters. Chapters 3 to 15 set out objectives and actions for 13 strategic outcomes. The table below contains an extract from these chapters and shows the objectives and actions that impact on local government and to which the Municipality can contribute.

## THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK (MTSF)

The National Cabinet approved the new Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) as the national implementation framework for the NDP. The MTSF defines the strategic objectives and targets for the National Government’s term of office. The MTSF is structured around 13 priority outcomes which cover the focus areas identified in the NDP, namely:

1. Providing quality basic education;
2. Improving health care; or the health system;
3. Reducing crime;
4. Creating jobs;
5. Developing the skills and infrastructure required by the economy;
6. Promoting rural development;
7. Creating sustainable human settlements;
8. Delivering effective and efficient local government and public service;
9. Protecting the environment;
10. Fostering better international relations;
11. Enhancing social development;
12. Promoting social cohesion; and
13. Nation building.

## NATIONAL KEY PERFORMANCE AREAS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

The National Government Strategic Plan sets out Key Performance Areas (KPA) of Local Government. These remain relevant and this IDP has been developed to align to these KPA’s and are:

1. Municipal transformation and institutional development;
2. Basic service delivery;
3. Local economic development;
4. Municipal financial viability and management;
5. Good governance and public participation.
