# District Framework

The IDP of Bergrivier Municipality aligns to the strategic direction of the West Coast District Municipality (WCDM) as set out in its IDP and SDF. WCDM’s vision, mission and strategic objectives are set out below.

The vision of the West Coast District Municipality is:

> _**"A quality destination of choice through an open opportunity society."**_

The mission of the West Coast District Municipality is:

> &#x20;_**“To ensure outstanding service delivery on the West Coast by pursuing the West Coast District Municipality’s strategic objectives”.**_

The strategic objectives of the West Coast District Municipality are:

1. To ensure the environmental integrity of the district is improved.
2. To pursue economic growth and the facilitation of job opportunities.
3. To promote the social well–being of residents, communities and targeted social groups in the district.
4. To provide essential bulk services to the district.
5. To ensure good governance and financial viability

Furthermore, the West Coast District Municipality has several regional strategies which Bergrivier Municipality recognizes in the planning process. These regional strategies are:

* Regional economic development strategy;
* Tourism strategy;
* Integrated environmental strategy;
* &#x20;Estuary management plan;
* Integrated coastal management plan;
* Disaster management plan;
* District spatial development framework;
* GLS Master plan for bulk water system;
* &#x20;Bulk Infrastructure Master Plan;
* &#x20;Integrated Transport Plan;
* &#x20;Integrated waste management plan;
* &#x20;Feasibility study on alternative water sources;
* Air quality management plan;
* Communication strategy; and
* Regional Climate change strategy.

The process to develop a One Plan for each District also needs to be emphasized. All local municipalities in the West Coast played a pivotal role in the drafting of the Joint District Management Implementation Plan. The objectives of the DDM are to:

* solve the silos at a horizontal and vertical level;
* maximise impact and align plans and resources at our disposal through the development of “One District, One Plan and One Budget”;
* narrow the distance between people and government by strengthening the coordination role and capacities at the district level;
* ensure inclusivity through gender-responsive budgeting based on the needs and aspirations of our people and communities at a local level;
* build government capacity to support to municipalities;
* strengthen monitoring and evaluation at district and local levels;
* implement a balanced approach towards development between urban and rural areas;
* ensure sustainable development whilst accelerating initiatives to promote poverty eradication, employment and equality; and
* exercise oversight over budgets and projects in an accountable and transparent manner.

The Western Cape Government’s specific approach to the DDM is called the Joint District and Metro Approach (JDMA). The JDMA envisages for the three spheres of government to converge, using Intergovernmental Relation-engagements, to develop similar Western Cape strategic, development and planning priorities with aligned budgets and accelerated implementation for service delivery. The JDMA -

* is a geographical (district) and team based, citizen focused approach;
* has the output of a single implementation plan to provide planning and strategic priorities, developmental initiatives, service delivery and capacity building;
* has the desired outcome of improving the living conditions (lives) of citizens;
* has a horizontal interface (between provincial departments) and a vertical interface (National, Provincial and local government spheres);
* does not exclude local municipalities;
* is not a functions and power debate; and
* promotes collaboration using the District Coordinating Forum as the governance instrument for co- planning, co-budgeting and co-implementation to strengthen service delivery to communities.

The West Coast Development Implementation Plan cannot and does not replace existing prescribed development, departmental strategic and annual performance plans that each government sphere, department and state entity is responsible for. It is rather informed by these plans and once adopted it will guide the review of these plans and budgets. The plan will not necessarily detail or cover the full range of responsibilities that each sphere, department and entity must execute. **It focusses on the major commitments and changes required to catalyse and advance socio-economic transformation.**

The plan is also not a simple summation of entity plans but a strategic collaboratively synthesised plan that articulates development outcomes, targets and commitments. It is not in the same form or detail as existing long-term plans (sector plans, IDPs, PSPs or GDSs) and does not play the same role as these plans. It is an intergovernmental framework not belonging to any sphere or department. It is in the form of an intergovernmental and social compact that sets the broad direction, targets and synergies to inform all planning.
