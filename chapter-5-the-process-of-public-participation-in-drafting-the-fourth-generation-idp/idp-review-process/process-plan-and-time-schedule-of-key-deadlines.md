# Process Plan and Time Schedule of Key Deadlines

The community participation process to develop the Fifth Generation IDP took place in accordance with a Process Plan that was approved by the Municipal Council in August 2021 in terms of Sections 21(1) (b) and 53(1) (b) of the MFMA read together with Sections 28 and 34 of the Municipal Systems Act. It was further amended in May 2022 to make provision for the adoption of the predecessorâ€™s IDP with amendments. A Time Schedule of Key Deadlines is also approved on an annual basis determining the schedule of the annual review of the IDP and the compilation of the related budget. The IDP and budget processes are two distinct, but integrally linked processes which must be coordinated to ensure that they consistently align to one another.

The Time Schedule of Key Deadlines makes provision for public participation mechanisms and procedures to allow the public to provide input into the IDP as outlined above. The following figure outlines the schedule of meetings to be held every financial year of the 5th Generation IDP and provides an overview of the rhythm of the IDP:
