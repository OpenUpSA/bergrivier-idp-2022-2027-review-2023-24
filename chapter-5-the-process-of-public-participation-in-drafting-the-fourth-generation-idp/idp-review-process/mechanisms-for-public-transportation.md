# Mechanisms for Public Transportation

The objective of the public participation process is to solicit inputs for the 5th Generation IDP, and the following annual reviews and the Municipality established the following mechanisms to facilitate public participation:

_INDIVIDUAL SECTOR ENGAGEMENTS_

In a bid to enhance the quality of public participation outcomes, Bergrivier is divided into 14 sectors and conduct engagement with individual sectors and its registered stakeholders on a continuous basis. Formal sector engagements take the form of on-going two-way dialogues between and amongst sector representatives and the Municipality. It proofs to be very effective as the sectors focus on issues and means of resolving issues jointly. These sectors also enable the Municipality to solicit more detailed inputs than is possible in public meetings. The following diagram illustrates the sectorial division of the Bergrivier Community.

_WARD COMMITTEE MEETINGS_

Ward committees are the most important mechanism for public participation. The new term of office of the ward committees commenced in February 2022 after elections were held in November 2021. Ward committees consist of not more than 10 members and are either elected as per sectors (as identified in the ward committee policy) or per geographical area or a combination of both. Due to the unique nature of wards, different compositions of ward committees may apply.

In terms of the approved Time Schedule of Key Deadlines, two series of Ward Committee Meetings are specifically convened as part of the IDP/budget process. The first series of meetings are held in September/ October of each year and is aimed at soliciting input from communities on their needs and to prioritise the needs by the various sectors represented on the Ward Committees. The second series of Ward Committee Meetings are be held in April of each financial year and is aimed at providing Ward Committees with the opportunity to comment on the Draft IDP Revision and Budget. The remainder of ward committee meetings are held to monitor progress and to implement their own projects as per identified priorities.

_TOWN BASED PUBLIC MEETINGS_

Town based public meetings are convened as part of the IDP/budget process. The first series of public meetings are normally held in September/October of each year and comprise of public meetings convened in every town in Bergrivier municipal area. During the first series of meetings, input from the community on needs and the prioritisation thereof is solicited and aligned with the needs identified by the ward committees. The major aim of these meetings is therefore:

* Providing feedback to the Community on progress made with the addressing of previously identified needs;
* Explaining the IDP Revision / Budget process;
* Presenting and confirming the ward needs review and re-prioritisation done by the Ward Committees;
* Providing an opportunity for additional input; and
* Prioritising the needs of the community.

Notice of public meetings are placed on the Municipal Website and on all Municipal Notice Boards. Meetings are also advertised in the press. Supplementary notifications are also being done which may differ from ward to ward such as SMS’s, flyers in post boxes, flyers delivered to houses and flyers handed out to people when they pay their municipal account. People who are unable to read and write are encouraged to visit the municipal offices for the necessary assistance.

_IDP REPRESENTATIVE FORUM_

The IDP Representative Forum is a meeting of the leaders of the various sectors and is convened by the Mayor and Municipal Manager. On 28 August 2012, the Municipal Council approved the establishment of an IDP Representative Forum in terms of Section 15 of the Local Government: Municipal Planning and Performance Management Regulations of 2001.

IDP Representative Forum meetings are held bi-annually and takes place in Piketberg and Velddrif. The municipal area is divided into 2 geographical areas and sector leaders are requested to attend one of these meetings. Representatives from the District Municipality, Provincial Government Departments, Ward Committees, NGO’s and Sector Representatives within the Community normally attend. These meetings are also held in September/October and April of the same financial year. To ensure alignment with the Joint District Management Approach of the Western Cape Provincial Government and with the various sector activities, a thematic approach is being used during these meetings.
