# Introduction

The role of the municipality in the fulfilment of the IDP is important. The municipality plays primarily the role of the enabler and facilitator to ensure that the vision, strategic goals and strategic objectives are being fulfilled. It is therefore imperative that the municipality has the ability, capacity and resources to ensure the systematic implementation of the various programme identified in the IDP.

The purpose of this chapter is to outline the organisational structure and various sector plans and frameworks to implement the programmes of the IDP.
