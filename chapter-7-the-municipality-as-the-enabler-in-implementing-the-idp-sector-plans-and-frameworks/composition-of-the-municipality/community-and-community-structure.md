# Community and Community Structure

The Constitution requires the Municipality to encourage the participation of community members and community organisations in the matters of local government. The Community play an integral role in municipal processes and decision making and the challenge is to find the most effective method of implementing two-way communication and interaction.

The Municipality’s principle structures are Ward Committees, the IDP Representative Forum and Sector Engagements. Chapter 5 explains how these forums are utilised for the IDP process.

* **WARD COMMITTEES**

Ward Committees are appointed in terms Sections 72 -78 of the Municipal Structures Act and is the communication channel between the Municipality and the Community. Although ward committees are not political structures, it is coupled to the term of office of the Municipal Council. In February 2022 new ward committees were elected. Ward Committees are elected on a sector basis which may include geographic sectors. The diversity of sectors within wards results in the composition of the different Ward Committees differing from ward to ward. Sectors include but are not limited to Ratepayer organisations, Agriculture and agriculture subsectors, organised business, Small businesses, Health, Religion, Community Police Forums, Youth, Social development, Education and training, Sport, Tourism and Women’s organisations.

* **IDP REPRESENTATIVE FORUM**

On 28 August 2013, the Municipal Council approved the establishment of an IDP Representative Forum in terms of Section 15 of Municipal Planning and Performance Management Regulations. The IDP Representative Forum comprises the following:

* Two ward committee members from each Municipal Ward;
  * One representative from the West Coast District Municipality;
  * The Executive Mayor, Speaker, Portfolio Committee Chairpersons and two additional councillors from the other parties represented on Council;
  * Three officials namely; the Municipal Manager, Strategic Manager, Head; Strategic Services and LED; and
