I am honoured to be the Executive Mayor of Bergrivier Municipality and proud to present the Fifth Generation Integrated Development Plan (IDP) for the period 2022 â€“ 2027. According to the Western Cape Government Regional Socio-Economic Profile (SEP 2022) Bergrivier Municipality caters for an estimated 75 484 people which equates to 18 497 households. In spite of our daunting economic challenges our modus operandi has always been based on openness and equality as is evident by the basic service delivery accessibility figures:

* Water 99.3%
* Refuse removal 77.7% (22.3%: agricultural land and Moravian Church property)
* Electricity 96.4%
* Sanitation 96.9%
* Housing 95.1%

Our IDP is built on the strengths of the preceding ones, it is externally focussed and driven by community needs. In order to uphold our vision: Bergrivier - A prosperous community where all want to live, work, learn and play in a dignified manner; we have once again refined our strategic goals and objectives to continue making the biggest possible impact on economic and social development while we endeavour to strengthen relationships and the sense of solidarity among our community for the next 5 years.

Bergrivier Municipality and its community has endured one obstacle after the other; COVID-19 and its effects that lingers on, increasing debt burden, high inflation, water restrictions, power outages and more; and yet we rise to each occasion and face it head on. The obstacles are challenging but it has taught us how to adapt, very often we have to make the difficult decisions, but we always endeavour to provide the best services for the sake of the community.

The Bergrivier winning formula = process excellence + accomplished team + true partnerships. To that I take this opportunity to convey our sincerest appreciation to our partners, stakeholders, community and ward committee members for their willingness to participate and their valuable contributions. A special vote of thanks to the Council of Bergrivier, Municipal Manager, Senior Management and all the staff for their tireless support and hard work, your passion to improve the lives of others is admirable.

All glory to God.
