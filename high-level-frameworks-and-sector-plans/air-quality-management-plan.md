# Air Quality Management Plan

The Municipal Council adopted an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) in November 2019.

Integrated Second Generation of the West Coast District Municipality inclusive of Bergrivier Municipality’s Air Quality Management Plan, 2019- 2024, dated 21 July 2019 was prepared by Enviroworks (appointed by WCDM). Bergrivier Municipality has obtained a Dust measurement apparatus, GrayWolf during the 2021/22 financial year. The GrayWolf 3016-A IAQ 6 Channel Particle Counter is used to measure particle counts or particulate concentration. Training was provided and software was installed on the work laptop of the Environmental Management Officer for this dust measurement apparatus.

The West Coast District Municipality has funded and installed an ambient air quality monitoring station located at Velddrif within the Bergrivier Municipality. Data collection takes place daily for the Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) levels monitored for the region and the station is fitted with a meteorological station. The station is managed by an independent service provider.

Levels of this pollutant is captured in the monthly reports submitted to the West Coast District Municipality and distributed from there to the Bergrivier Municipality.

The strategic goals and objectives of the AQMP mentioned above, are:

1. _“Implementing the Air Quality Management Plan within the Local Municipality;_
2. _Assigning clear responsibilities and functions for air quality management at both district and Local levels;_
3. _Air quality training of current and future air quality personnel at both district and Local levels;_
4. _Obtaining the necessary resources and funding for air quality management in the Local Municipality;_
5. _Preliminary monitoring of identified ‘hotspot’ areas in the Municipality to determine air pollutant concentrations;_
6. _Undertaking continuous ambient air quality monitoring to obtain a long-term record of air quality in the Municipality;_
7. _Maintaining good air quality within the boundaries of the Local Municipality, with specific emphasis on PM10 and SO2 concentrations;_
8. _Compliance monitoring and enforcement of air quality legislation, policies and regulations in the Local Municipality; and_
9. _Assessing the contribution of agriculture to ambient air quality and establishing measures to control emissions from these sources”._
