# Water Services Development Plan

The Municipality adopted a Water Services Development Plan (WSDP) for 2017 - 2022 in terms of the Water Services Act, 1997 (Act 108 of 1997). The overarching objectives of the WSDP are:

1. _“To provide for the housing needs of the residents of Bergrivier in a continuous and sustained manner by timely future planning while preserving its distinctive character;_
2. _To, in co-operation with other role-players, provide the residents of Bergrivier with a healthy economic basis and create a quality environment by sustained planning and in doing to so create job opportunities as well as to promote the expansion of tourism;_
3. _To provide the residents of Bergrivier with a healthy and safe living environment through the timely establishment of the necessary community facilities;_
4. _To empower the residents of Bergrivier by the provision and exposure to the necessary academic as well as practical training facilities;_
5. _To support the residents of Bergrivier with the necessary sporting and recreational facilities; and_
6. _To preserve, conserve and expand the conservation worthy natural environment in harmony with future town development”._

The two most critical issues addressed in the WSDP are:

* The eradication of water and sanitation backlogs:

All households have access to basic water and sanitation. The backlogs that exist pertain to the development of new houses and backyard dwellers. Grants provided by National Government (MIG funds) will be utilised for the upgrading of water and sanitation bulk and service infrastructure.

* Water Conservation and Water Demand Management (WC/WDM):

The Municipality monitors its water losses monthly and is experiencing a decline in its water losses. There are several interventions in place to curb water losses and a consolidated Water Conservation and Demand Strategy was compiled in 2021 to elucidate the need for WC/WDM in Bergrivier Municipality.
