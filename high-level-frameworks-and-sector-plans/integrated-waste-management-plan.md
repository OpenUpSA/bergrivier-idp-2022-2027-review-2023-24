# Integrated Waste Management Plan

The 4th generation Integrated Waste Management Plan (IWMP) was approved by Council in terms of NEMA: WA on condition that comments be obtained from the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (DEADP). These comments led to a revision that was completed.

Training on Integrated Pollutant and Waste Information System (IPWIS) has been done by the Department of Environmental Affairs in April 2015 as all waste types and quantities must be reported online in accordance with the Waste Information System regulations. Emphasis is placed om the appointing of a full time Waste Officer to comply with the National Environmental Management: Waste Act, 2008 (NEWMA), (Act 59 of 2008). The municipality installed weigh bridges in Piketberg and Velddrif MRFâ€™s to determine quantities. Integrated Waste by-laws were renewed in 2021 to aligned with (NEWMA).
