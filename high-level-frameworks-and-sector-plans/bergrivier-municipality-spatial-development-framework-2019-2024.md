# Bergrivier Municipality Spatial Development Framework (2019 - 2024)

The Bergrivier Municipal Spatial Development Framework, 2018 (MSDF) has been compiled in terms of the provisions of the Municipal Systems Act, 2000 (MSA, Act 32 of 2000), the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act, 2013 (SPLUMA, Act 16 of 2013), the Western Cape Land Use Planning Act, 2014 (LUPA, Act 3 of 2014) and the Bergrivier Municipality By-Law Relating to Municipal Land Use Planning (the By-Law, as per PN 7910 of 6 April 2018.). The Municipal Council approved a new MSDF on 26 February 2019 and is valid until 2024.

The Spatial Development Framework (SDF) indicates which type of development should be allowed in the Municipality, where it should take place, and how such development should be undertaken to ensure the best possible outcomes for the Community. It is a spatial manifestation of the IDP and there must be alignment between the two.

The work set out in this document has been informed by a series of engagements with key stakeholders as well as technical specialists and Bergrivier Municipality officials. Apart from one-on-one consultations held with residents, with technical officials of the Bergrivier Municipality, and consultations with fellow professionals with direct experience in the study area, the formal engagements undertaken sought to align with the Municipality’s IDP programme and schedule of meetings for public participation.

Translating the Legal and Policy Directives into a Spatial Development Concept:

Based on the policy directives drawn from the array of international, national, provincial and municipal-scale legal and policy instruments, the Bergrivier Municipality’s conceptual approach to spatial development and land use management seeks to embody its IDP Vision and enable the realization of this Vision by focusing on:

* Pursuing social and spatial justice by seeking to promote spatial transformation and the integration of its settlements wherever possible and within available means;
* The promotion of key linkages to hinterland areas where synergistic development processes may be possible;
* A focus on a sustainable investment strategy for the development of infrastructure and facilities that are necessary to underpin social and economic development; and
* The wise management of:
  * land and natural resources
  * Heritage and cultural landscapes
