# Integrated Transport Plan

The Municipality approved the Integrated Transport Plan (ITP) for 2019 - 2024, but its needs are incorporated into the West Coast District Municipality Integrated Transport Plan which is currently under review. The Table below sets out the current needs for Bergrivier Municipality.

One of the most important additional aspects of the transport plan is the need to enhance mobility of the residents within the major towns between the residential areas and the central business district.
