# Climate Change Adaptation Plan

The Municipality is participating in the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (DEADP) Municipal Support Programme and has been assisted to develop a Climate Change Adaption Plan (CCAP).

The Plan identifies 5 intervention areas namely;

1. Mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into municipal governance;
2. Climate resilient low-income housing;
3. Storm water management;
4. Conservation of natural resources; and
5. Agriculture.

Other matters aligning climate change with infrastructure development, resonates on the completion of the Bergrivier Electricity Master Plan funded by Provincial Government, the Integrated Transport Plan and the Integrated Waste Management Plan, with a focus on reduction of waste transport, contribute to managing climate change matters.

1. **MAINSTREAMING OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION INTO MUNICIPAL GOVERNANCE**

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>PROBLEM STATEMENT</th><th>PROJECT</th><th>DETAIL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Adaptation to climate change should not be viewed as a separate function of the Municipality but rather be mainstreamed as a consideration in all planning and development. Capacity needs to be developed amongst all stakeholders, knowledge co-produced and shared, and valuable experience developed around successful climate adaptation. A priority that needs to be addressed is how to get increased political buy-in to the climate adaptation process to ensure that the identified adaptation interventions can be taken forward effectively. The timeline for the implementation of identified adaptation interventions will depend on the availability of funding, and if there is no available funding how long it will take to source funding Successful implementation is also dependant on the coordination of environmental forums/structures.</td><td>Capacity building and awareness – officials and decision makers to create buy in.</td><td><ul><li>Training and information dissemination</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Adaptation to climate change should not be viewed as a separate function of the Municipality but rather be mainstreamed as a consideration in all planning and development.

3. **STORM WATER MANAGEMENT**

5. **AGRICULTURE**

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>PROBLEM STATEMENT</th><th>PROJECT</th><th>DETAIL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The agriculture sector was less involved in this planning process, which is primarily attributable to the time of year when the meetings were held. Despite this there was a great interest in climate change and the impact thereof on the agriculture sector. The contribution of the Agriculture sector in funding some of the early work on the implications of climate change for the Sandveld is also acknowledged. The sector thus needs to be a priority for further engagement. It was suggested that a forum be established so that farmers (small-scale and commercial) can be assisted with long-term planning, and the clear identification of stresses, priority threats and adaptation opportunities, as well as integration within the municipality strategy. This will also be necessary so that the agricultural sector can be represented more in the IDP planning process, as an on-going engagement. There was a suggestion that a municipal representative participate in the existing agricultural unions which could be taken further, as the unions have on several occasions expressed interest in understanding climate change implications.</td><td>Agriculture</td><td><ul><li>Targeted participatory planning process for Agricultural Sector in IDP (Agriculture Sector engagements)</li><li>Mainstream agriculture sector into municipal planning</li><li>Municipality should have a representative on the Agriculture Union</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>
