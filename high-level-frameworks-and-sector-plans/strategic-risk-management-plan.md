# Strategic Risk Management Plan

Section 62(1)(c)(i) of the MFMA states that: “ The accounting officer of the municipality is responsible for managing the financial administration of the municipality and must for this purpose take all reasonable steps to ensure that the municipality has and maintains effective, efficient and transparent systems of financial and risk management and internal control.”

Bergrivier Municipality is committed to the optimal management of risk in order to protect our core public service values, achieve our vision, objectives and deliver on our core business functions. In the course of conducting our daily business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks. These risks include operational and other material risks which require comprehensive controls and ongoing oversight to be properly managed. To ensure business success the Municipality have adopted an enterprise-wide integrated approach to the management of risks. By embedding the risk management process into key business processes such as planning, operations and new projects, the municipality will be better equipped to identify events affecting our objectives. When properly executed, risk management provides reasonable assurance that the municipality will be successful in achieving its goals and objectives. A Risk Register has been compiled and is reviewed on an annual basis. Risks are managed through an internet-based risk management system. Reports on risk management are submitted to the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis.
