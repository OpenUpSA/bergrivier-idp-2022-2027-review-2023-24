# Bergrivier Municipality Biodiversity Report (2010)

The Municipality is a member of Local Action for Biodiversity (LAB) Programme, which is run by ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability’s Global Biodiversity Centre, in partnership with International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The key objective of the LAB programme is to support municipalities to integrate biodiversity into all aspects of their local governance. The report provides a detailed assessment of the status quo of our biodiversity and biodiversity management in the Bergrivier Municipal Area. This document forms the basis for the LBSAP which is a practical plan to give effect to the Bergrivier Municipality Biodiversity Report. The objectives of the LBSAP are:

1. _“Full integration of biodiversity conservation into the institutional and planning frameworks, governance and regulatory processes and policies of Bergrivier Municipality._
2. _Management, conservation and sustainable utilisation of Bergrivier Municipality’s aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity assets._
3. _Community appreciation and active participation in the conservation of Bergrivier Municipality’s biodiversity._
4. _Enhanced human well-being and poverty reduction through the mainstreaming of biodiversity conservation into the local economy.”_

The LBSAP identifies projects that will be implemented over a 10-year timeframe. Resource constraints have resulted in a re-prioritisation of projects with specific focus on the revision of the SDF, recycling, composting, awareness and the development of a botanical garden which will be on-going. The LBSAP projects are indicated in the table below:
