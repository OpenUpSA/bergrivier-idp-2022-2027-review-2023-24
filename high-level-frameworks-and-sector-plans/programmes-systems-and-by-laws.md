# Programmes, Systems and By-laws

The Municipality also has several programmes, systems and by-laws in place namely:

**INTEGRATED MUNICIPAL INFORMATION SYSTEM**

Bergrivier Municipality identified the need for an integrated document and records management system that supports the medium to long term information needs of the municipality. The system officially came into operation on 1 June 2013 and assists the Municipality to manage its documents, agendas and minutes, calendars, contracts. The System also has a Customer Care Module for the management of complaints.

**COMMUNICATION**

The Municipality has a Communication Section mandated to manage and co-ordinate the communication of the strategic vision, mission, values, organisational culture and being of Bergrivier Municipality with and to all stakeholders, networks, officials, councillors and to create and design all material linked to it.

This section, which falls under the Office of the Municipal Manager, has a Head: Communications who reports directly to the Municipal Manager. The Communication Section is responsible for the following:

1. managing the public relations and media liaison functions;
2. manage all internal and external promotional and marketing related communication;&#x20;
3. manage the official Facebook Page and Public WhatsApp Groups of Bergrivier Municipality;
4. &#x20;manage the Corporate Wear Initiative within the Municipality;
5. Taking photographs and doing videography;
6. manage all the TV Screens at the Reception Desks in the different Municipal Offices by ensuring that they are updated on a quarterly basis with relevant content;
7. manage all design work for the Municipality;
8. drafting and updating of the Communications Policy and Social Media Policy; and
9. managing all communication projects.

The Communications Unit regularly engages with the media (especially local media) to generate and maintain a positive image of the Municipality in the public space, by drafting municipal content for publication in local newspapers/ and online platforms. The Municipality publishes a quarterly external newsletter titled “Bergrivier Bulletin” to keep residents abreast with all the latest Municipal news. This is a digital newsletter which gets issued via the Municipality’s official communication platforms.

Bergrivier Municipality also has its own website [www.bergmun.org.za](https://www.bergmun.org.za) which is used to place all tenders, formal quotations, vacancies, notices, and all other important documents for public viewing. The Municipality’s Communication Unit manages the Municipality’s official Facebook Page titled “Bergrivier Bulletin”, whereby social media campaigns are run on this platform to inform, educate, and engage with residents regarding various municipal and community matters. The TV Screens at all municipal reception desks in the various towns within the Bergrivier Municipal Area are updated by the Communications Unit with the latest content for the public to take note of. This is an ideal method to keep residents who visit any municipal office informed of the organisation’s activities via a slideshow of important and interesting quarterly events.

**PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT**

Performance Management is done in terms of the Performance Management Policy approved on 26 June 2019 and is currently in the process of review. The Performance Management System is an internet-based system that uses the approved Service Delivery Budget Implementation Plan (SDBIP) as its basis. The SDBIP is a layered plan comprising a Top Layer SDBIP and Departmental SDBIPs. The Top Layer SDBIP is developed following the approval of the budget and comprises quarterly high-level service delivery targets. Performance reporting on the top layer SDBIP is done to the Mayoral Committee and Council on a quarterly, half yearly (Mid-year Budget and Performance Assessment Report) and annual basis (Annual Report). These performance reports are made available on our website.

**COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT**

Compliance is managed through an internet-based compliance management system Eunomia, which was implemented in July 2013. Reports on compliance are submitted to the Performance and Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.
