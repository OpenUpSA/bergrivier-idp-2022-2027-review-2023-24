# Sector Plans and Frameworks in the Department Administrative Services

* **INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY**

ICT plays a vital role in the acceleration of the flow of information and knowledge between local government and citizens. The same can be said with regards to the promotion of the effective and efficient interaction between local government and citizens. It is for this reason that ICT within the municipal context has enjoyed great interest from Management. It has matured from being operational focused to enhancing Service delivery through various platforms. The greater attention is evident from the governance of ICT to the policies and applications that are in operation.

Some of the goals of IT include:

* Ensure stakeholder value of business: This is to ensure that municipal systems are aligned with ICT Strategy and or is aligned to the IDP.
* Managed Business risk (safeguarding of assets including information). Provide security of information, processing infrastructure and applications
* Ensure compliance with external laws and internal policies.
* Create a customer-orientated service culture. Ensuring adequate use of applications, information and technology to enable service delivery using ICT.

Both the enabling of participatory governance as well as the interpretation of large amounts of collected data require the existence and development of an extensive, robust and scalable ICT infrastructure. The complete sector plan for ICT is available electronically.

* **RECORDS AND ARCHIVES**

Records Management is a process of ensuring the proper creation, maintenance, use and disposal of records to achieve efficient, transparent and accountable governance. Sound records management is a collective responsibility which all staff members have an equal obligation to maintain.

Records management can only be effective and efficient if:

* Records are considered a business process designed to support business objectives;
* Records are considered a resource and are utilised fully and cost effectively to realise business objectives;&#x20;
* A record management culture is created and maintained which will facilitate efficient and timely decision making.
* All users are aware of the policies, procedures and tools for managing records. The full co-operation of users is necessary to file documents into the filing system and to protect records against loss and damage.
* Update website information.
* During 2020 the Auditor-General South Africa (AGSA) in conjunction with the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) developed the Local Government Records Management Toolkit. The Toolkit is intended to provide guidance to municipalities on the understanding of Records Management in order to ensure transparency, good governance, accountability, business continuity and service delivery in local government. The publication aims to assist Municipalities to maintain, manage and use records in line with sound records management principles. The Toolkit was developed with the tools and support of the National Archives and Records Services of South Africa. ([http://www.nationalarchives.gov.za/](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.za/))
