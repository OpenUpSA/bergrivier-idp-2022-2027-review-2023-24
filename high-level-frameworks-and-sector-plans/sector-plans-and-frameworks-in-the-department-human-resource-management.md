**THE EMPLOYMENT EQUITY PLAN**

The Employment Equity Act, 1998, (Act 55 of 1998) requires the Municipality to develop an Employment Equity Plan. The Employment Equity Plan must comply with the requirements set out in section 20 (1) of the Act. The Employment Equity Act (EEA) makes it compulsory for designated employers to implement affirmative action (AA). The Municipality is a designated employer and is therefore required to employ, train and retain the services of employees belonging to designated previously disadvantaged population groups.

The objectives of the Employment Equity Plan are to:

1. _“Promote equal opportunity and fair treatment in employment through the elimination of unfair discrimination;_
2. _Promoting diversity and respect for all employees;_
3. &#x20;_Identify training and development needs, and to develop and encourage skills development for all our staff in keeping with functional and strategic requirements;_
4. _Make a positive contribution to the affirmation of historically disadvantaged individuals in a meaningful and constructive manner; and_
5. &#x20;_Achieving equitable representation of all demographic groups at all levels and in all categories of the workforce as ultimate tangible objective.”_

The Municipality’s goal is to achieve a workforce profile that is broadly representative of the Western Cape people by the end of October 2024, and this is done through the setting of numerical goals. The following table sets out the Municipality’s Employment Equity goals:

The complete Employment Equity Sector Plan is available as electronically.

**THE WORKPLACE SKILLS PLAN**

To empower its employees and enhance its human capital, the Municipality provides various learning and development opportunities for employees and councillors. The Municipality develops a Workplace Skills Plan (WSP) annually and the plan with implementation reports are annually submitted to the Local Government SETA.

The Training Committee is functional, and the municipality participates in the shared training programmes that are facilitated across the District. The municipality annually provides for bursaries for employees and also participates in the Provincial Treasury Capacity Building programme. The complete Workplace Skills Plan is available electronically.
