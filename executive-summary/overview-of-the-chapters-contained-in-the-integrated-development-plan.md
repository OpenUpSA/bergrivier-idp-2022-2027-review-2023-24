# Overview of the chapters contained in the Integrated Development Plan

## Chapter 1: Purpose of the IDP

Integrated development planning is both a process and a plan that is undertaken in terms of legislation and within the parameters of National, Provincial and District planning frameworks. The integrated development planning process is a consultative process that solicits input from a wide range of stakeholders.

The IDP process aims to identify and prioritise Municipal, and Community needs and integrate them into a singular local level plan which indicates how resources will be allocated to address these needs over the fiveyear cycle of the IDP. The IDP also identifies critical development needs which fall within the functional mandate of the West Coast District Municipality, National and Provincial Government Departments and their Public Entities and indicates how these needs will be addressed in the short, medium and long term (where information is available) and how they align to municipal planning.
