# Introduction

The municipality as the enabler and facilitator of the Integrated Development Plan needs to plan programmes and projects for the period 2022 – 2026. These plans must be linked to the strategic goals and objectives as outlined in Chapter 2 and must ensure that the identified goals and objectives are being reached. These programmes/projects can at the time of drafting the IDP either be funded or unfunded but needs to be incorporated into the IDP to ensure that the planning process is complete. Funding for the unfunded programmes/projects necessarily needs to be sourced.

This chapter is an overview of the focus areas per directorate linked to the identified strategic goals and strategic objectives. The purpose of this chapter is therefore to give an overview of the intended programmes for the period 2022 – 2027.
