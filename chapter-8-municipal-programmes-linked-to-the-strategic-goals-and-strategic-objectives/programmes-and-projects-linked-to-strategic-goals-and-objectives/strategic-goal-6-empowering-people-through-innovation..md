An extended services such as Library of the blind audiobooks and E-Books (Libby) are a new addition to our service. The public library consists of four (4) components, librarians, library material, patrons and buildings. The librarian should strive to empower the community, improve the quality of life, encourage a lifelong learning, connect people with technology and reach out to people of all ages.
