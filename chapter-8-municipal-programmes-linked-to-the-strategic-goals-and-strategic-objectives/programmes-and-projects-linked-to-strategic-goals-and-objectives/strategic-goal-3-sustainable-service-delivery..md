# Strategic Goal 3: Sustainable Service Delivery.

## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1: DEVELOP AND PROVIDE BULK INFRASTRUCTURE WITHING THE CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS.

Although there is a major improvement in the spare capacity of especially bulk water and wastewater infrastructure, care must be taken to allow for developments within the limits of the available bulk capacity.

1. _WATER_

The Municipality provides water services to all towns in its area of jurisdiction except for Goedverwacht, Wittewater and De Hoek which are private towns.

**CHALLENGES**

* **Bulk service provision**

Bulk water supply is one of the most critical development issues and features high on the priority lists of almost all our towns. Construction of a new reservoir in Piketberg is a high priority and is currently in the construction phase. The WTW in Porterville needs to be upgraded to accommodate the demand for low-cost housing. A further challenge is to explore additional sources for water supply at Aurora, Redelinghuis and Porterville. Procuring of chlorine gas has become a major problem as there is a national shortage and alternative sources to disinfect potable water are under investigation.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

1. **Reducing bulk and service infrastructure capacity backlogs (water)**

The Water Conservation and Demand Management Plan was developed and assists a great deal in reducing our water backlogs with minimal financial implications. Investigations need to commence regarding water security and the development of new water sources be considered.

2. **Master Plan development and revision**

Update of the Water and Sewerage Master Plans are in process and will be funded by DBSA.

3. **Water Services Development Plan**

The Water Services Development Plan (WSDP) is under review and will be funded by DBSA. Water losses at the end of the 2020/21 financial year were at 16 %.

The full capital program is contained in Chapter 10, but the most significant capital development priorities are indicated on the table below:

2. _SANITATION_

The Municipality provides sanitation services to all towns in its area of jurisdiction except for Goedverwacht, Wittewater and De Hoek which are private towns.

**CHALLENGES**

Challenges impacting on the delivery of basic services (sanitation) are:

* Procuring of chlorine gas has become a major problem as there is a national shortage and alternative sources to disinfect potable water are under investigation.
* Bulk service provision.

Adequate bulk sanitation capacity is a prerequisite to development and insufficient bulk capacity is limiting development potential, especially in Porterville and Velddrif. Bergrivier Municipality started with the upgrading of the Wastewater Treatment Works at Porterville during the 2017/18 financial year. Due to financial constraints, finalising the project depends on funding (external and internal). The civil component as well as the mechanical and electrical components of the wastewater treatment works (WWTW) are completed. However, funding is needed for the construction of the sludge drying beds and service roads on site. The capacity of the WWTW has been doubled from 0.75 Ml/day to a capacity of 1.5 Ml/day.

Upgrading of the Piketberg WWTW is required in order that the final effluent to comply with norms and standards. The municipality applied for external funding (WSIG) and it is anticipated that construction will start in the 2025/26 financial year.

Another challenge is to investigate alternative sewage treatment methods in Aurora and Redelinghuis where no waterborne systems exist, and a service provider has been appointed to liaise with the Department of Water and Sanitation in this regard.

Upgrading and extension to the Dwarskersbos WWTW require urgent attention and will start in March 2023.

* **Compliance with Blue and Green Drop Standards**

Compliance to Blue and Drop Standards is becoming increasingly difficult and costly, and the Municipality has insufficient funding to appoint staff (Plant operators), upgrade plants and network infrastructure to adhere to the compliance prerequisites.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

* **Reducing bulk and service infrastructure capacity backlogs**

The upgrading of the Piketberg and Velddrif Wastewater Treatment Works with the least spare capacity available is the highest priority to reduce the Wastewater backlogs.

* **Master Plan development and revision**

Update of the Water and Sewerage Master Plans are in process and will be funded by DBSA.

* **Personnel**

Appointing of qualified WWTW operators according to legislation is a high priority.

The full capital program is contained in Chapter 10, but the most significant capital development priorities are indicated on the table below:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 3.23.37 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. _ELECTRICITY_

The Municipality is responsible for the distribution of electricity in all urban areas except Goedverwacht, Wittewater and De Hoek. The Municipality only distributes electricity to a small portion of Eendekuil where the low-cost houses are situated (162 households). ESKOM distributes electricity to the areas not serviced by the Municipality.

**CHALLENGES**

**Bulk service provision**

There is an adequate bulk supply at this stage, but additional capacity may be required to accommodate development applications depending on the energy requirements of the development. Although there is currently enough capacity available in general, Velddrif and Piketberg is fast reaching their maximum capacity. Energy control measures like the implementation of solar panels, the installation of LED lights and a ripple control system will also become a priority to curbed and control usage rather than expanding the Eskom capacity at a very high cost.

The Municipality also start preparing look at innovative methods to manage energy supply and/or alternative means of energy.

Load shedding and cable theft during this period has become a major challenge. The cost involved is astronomic. The switchgear of the electrical network was not designed to be swathed so many times.

Additional sources of electricity need to be sourced to ensure sustainability of supply especially considering the current loadshedding environment. Bergrivier Municipality will be embarking on a request for proposals to enable the process to supply sustained electricity.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

* The upgrading of bulk services and reticulation network
* The minimization of electricity losses

Electricity losses were 12.49 % for 2021/22 financial year and the municipality will strive to continuously reduce losses (on-going).

The full capital program is contained in Chapter 10, but the most significant capital development priorities are indicated on the table below:

4. _ROADS (INCLUDING CURBS AND PAVEMENTS)_

**CHALLENGES**

Roads are maintained and developed in accordance with the Pavement Management System of 2010. The Community expressed dissatisfaction with the state of the roads during the previous IDP Public Participation Process, but many of the roads that they were dissatisfied with are Provincial roads which were given through to the Department of Transport and Public Works. The Municipality plans to upgrade some of the roads in the smaller towns by using own funds and MIG funds.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

* The upgrading of the road network;&#x20;
* The Pavement Management System and Storm Water Master Plan must be updated regularly (subject to funding);
* Appoint sufficient staff where needed;&#x20;
* Status of Provincial roads was evaluated and submitted to PAWC for funding to rehabilitation; and&#x20;
* Noordhoek/Church lane in Velddrif in need of new construction.

The full capital programme is contained in Chapter 10, but the most significant capital development priorities are indicated on the table below:

5. _STORM WATER_

**CHALLENGES**

Storm water infrastructure is maintained and developed in accordance with the Storm Water Master Plan in Piketberg and Porterville, which are the priority areas. The Municipality plans to use MIG funds to alleviate some of the storm water problems in ward 4.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

Systematic upgrading and maintenance of the storm water systems.

The full capital program is contained in Chapter 10, but the most significant storm water capital development priorities are indicated on the table below:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 4.02.56 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

6. _SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT_

**CHALLENGES**

**Land fill sites**

The rehabilitation of landfill sites was deemed a priority by almost all our communities which is testimony to an ever-increasing level of environmental awareness that must be encouraged. All the landfills are licenced, but the rehabilitation costs of these sites remain a challenge. The total rehabilitation cost of the landfill sites is estimated at R 87 million rand. The Municipality does not have the cash reserves for this expenditure, but nevertheless regards it as a priority and will endeavour to obtain funding. The closure and rehabilitation of the Velddrif site forms part of a land exchange in terms of which the new owner will bear the rehabilitation costs. Illegal dumping remains a major problem and requires huge financial cost to clean up constantly.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

* Implementation of the Draft Integrated Waste Management Plan;&#x20;
* Rehabilitation of solid waste disposal sites;&#x20;
* Fill unfunded/vacant post of fulltime dedicated Waste Officer;&#x20;
* Critical unfunded/vacant posts must be filled.

## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2: MAINTAIN EXISTING BULK INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES.

**INTRODUCTION**

Bergrivier Municipality strives to deliver uninterrupted services to all end users. This can only be obtained through well maintained infrastructures (Engineering services.)

In general, challenges include:

* Budget constraints;&#x20;
* &#x20;Lack of sufficient and skilled personnel;&#x20;
* Old infrastructure;&#x20;
* &#x20;Load Shedding;
* &#x20;Vandalism/theft;&#x20;
* Procurement processes;&#x20;
* GIS Data basis; and&#x20;
* Reseal and construction of roads network.

Development priorities as a whole include:

* Alternative energy generation;&#x20;
* &#x20;Replace old asbestos water and sewer pipes;&#x20;
* Renewal of WWTW and WTW;&#x20;
* Renewal of electrical networks; and&#x20;
* Rebuild/construction of roads network.

Bergrivier Municipality has water treatment plants in Piketberg, Porterville and Eendekuil that supply its own water. Aurora is supplied solely from boreholes and Redelinghuis from Matroosfontein. Velddrif and Dwarskersbos receive bulk water from Withoogte Water Treatment Plant which is a regional facility managed by the West Coast District Municipality.

Nevertheless, bulk services remain critical since it forms the basis from where services can be delivered particularly water. Water security is therefore essential especially amidst the ever-ageing infrastructure. In terms of electricity the existing bulk supply needs upgrading vis a vie segmentation and feeding processes to be enabled to accommodate new development.

Bergrivier Municipality also treats its sewerage at wastewater treatment plants in Piketberg, Porterville, Velddrif and Dwarskersbos. Eendekuil has ponds whereas Redelinghuis and Aurora has no bulk sewer services. Bergrivier Municipality does not generate its own electricity and supplies from ESKOM, except Eendekuil that receives directly from ESKOM.

Master Planning is critical for development planning and will be conducted with the assistance of DBSA. Following this is modelling of networks to enable Bergrivier Municipality to plan appropriately for future developments.

**CHALLENGES**

1. _WATER_

**CHALLENGES**

* **Service infrastructure:**

Maintenance and upgrading of the water network are done in accordance with the Water and Sewerage Master Plan and is on-going.

The replacement of asbestos pipe already started by means of pipe cracking and will continue.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

Master Planning is critical for development planning and will be conducted with the assistance of DBSA. Following this is modelling of networks to enable Bergrivier Municipality to plan appropriately for future developments.

## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3: DEVELOP, MANAGE AND REGULATE THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT.

* _SPATIAL PLANNING and LAND USE MANAGEMENT_

The Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act, 2013 (Act 16 of 2013) was introduced on 1 July 2015 as a national framework act for land use planning, hereafter referred to as SPLUMA. Within the Western Cape Province, the Western Cape Government repealed the Land Use Planning Ordinance, 1985 (Ordinance 15 of 1985) and approved the Western Cape Land Use Planning Act, 2014 (Act 3 of 2014), hereafter referred to as LUPA. Both SPLUMA and LUPA via their own legislative that municipalities must give effect to the provisions of SPLUMA and LUPA via their own legislative powers. Council passed in terms of section 156(2) of the Constitution read with section 11(3)(m) of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, 2000 (Act 32 of 2000) a law on municipal land use planning. Bergrivier Municipality: By-Law on Municipal Land Use Planning was subsequently published and later amended in the Provincial Gazette. The Municipal planning environment changed radically with the promulgation of the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act, 2013 (Act 16 of 2013) (SPLUMA) and the Provincial Land Use Planning Act, 2013 (LUPA) during the second half of 2015.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

1. **Implementation of SPLUMA and LUPA**

A Uniform Zoning Scheme was compiled and published in the Provincial Gazette Extraordinary on 17 June 2016.

2. **Re-development of Show Grounds: Piketberg**

Re-development of the show grounds was initiated through the Provincial RSEP program. Additional planning was done by means of the Piketberg Gateway and Central Integration Zone Precinct Plan for the surrounding municipal land, to optimise community integration potential. The planning is to incorporate this section in the Small-Town Regeneration programme.

3. **Precinct plans**

Expansion of Porterville Precinct Plan is required.

Piketberg was chosen as one of the national pilot projects in the Small-Town Regeneration Programme that is part of the Karoo Regional Spatial Development Framework. A Steering Committee was established and funding for the approved Piketberg Gateway and Central Integration Zone Precinct Plan will be sourced with the involvement and assistance of national and provincial government.

4. **Regulatory Framework for conservation and restoration of protected areas**

The Municipality has a protected area in Redelinghuis as well as other protected areas, e.g., the Berg River estuary (RAMSAR site) and these need to be effectively managed.

5. **Digital Transformation**

Digital transformation in order to align technology, employees and the Municipality’s functions for purposes of improving operational efficiency.



* _HOUSING_

In terms of the Constitution of South Africa, housing is a shared function between national and provincial government. The municipality’s role is limited to the management of the housing waiting list and the implementation of approved housing projects. _**The municipality is therefore only the implementation agent.**_ Projects for this function are listed under Housing Pipeline referred to in Chapter 4.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

**Housing Pipeline**

The full capital programme is contained in Chapter 10, but the most significant capital development priorities are indicated on the table below:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 4.23.28 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The municipality is in the process to appoint an Implementation agent for the following projects:

* The Haven&#x20;
* Piketberg 1000
* &#x20;Porterville Land Buy Out&#x20;
* Piketberg Land Buy Out&#x20;
* Trajekte Kamp Piketberg



* _BUILDING CONTROL_

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

The development of a problem building by-law and ensuring 100 % enforcement of building regulations will form the basis of the building control. On -going regulation of building activities.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 4.25.06 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* _RURAL DEVELOPMENT_

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

The Municipality needs to fully play the role that is required of it in terms of rural development. One of the key priorities will be the conclusion of a service delivery agreement with the Moravian Church of South Africa to render services in Goedverwacht and Wittewater, a process which commenced in 2012/13 and is on-going.

Negotiations with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform will also commence to identify potential projects for the alleviation of poverty and the creation of either jobs or business opportunities in the rural areas.

## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 4: SOURCE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL ELECTRICITY PROVISION.

**INTRODUCTION**

Considering South Africa’s current electricity supply crisis alternative means of electricity supply is sorely needed. Coupled with this is the current age of infrastructure that requires upgrading going into the future. Already Bergrivier Municipality developed a SSEG and wheeling policies for approval by council and adoption. This development will require issuing of RFPs to attract IPPs to invest in alternative sources of energy. A range of sources are considered such as PV and LNG and others that may be deemed feasible.

**CHALLENGES**

Challenges include:

* Age of current infrastructure to accept additional loads including pick up points;&#x20;
* Suitable land area for the development of PV;
* Defragmented network that does not assist in the implementation of the wheeling tariffs;
* &#x20;Implementation of wheeling tariffs due to Finance readiness; and
* Readiness for accepting alternative energy sources.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

* Network studies; and
* &#x20;Master planning to enable implementation of policies.

**THE BERG RIVER ESTUARY:**

The Berg River Estuary is the most valuable biodiversity asset in the Municipality and is home to a multitude of birds, fish and invertebrates and has its own unique vegetation. It is also a provider of a range of ecosystem services that support the local economy (fishing, salt production etc.). It is ranked as the third most important estuary of conservation importance in South Africa. Media press release was issued from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment on 3 February 2022: BERG ESTUARY DESIGNATED AS SOUTH AFRICA’S 28th WETLAND OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE - 2 FEBRUARY 2021

As the world marks World Wetlands Day 2022, South Africa is celebrating the declaration of its 28th wetland of international importance. The Berg Estuary in the Western Cape was declared as a RAMSAR Site under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance in time for the marking of World Wetlands Day.

The Western Cape Government, Department of Environmental Affairs & Development Planning (DEADP) and CapeNature issued The Groot Berg River Estuary Draft Estuarine Management Plan, dated August 2021 as invitation for public comment, published in Provincial Gazette Extraordinary No. 8538 of Friday 28 January 2022, time until 4 March 2022 for comments.

This document is a Management Plan for the Berg River Estuary. It was originally developed under the auspices of the Cape Action Plan for the Environment (C.A.P.E.) Estuaries Management Programme. The main aim of this programme was to develop a conservation plan for the estuaries of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), and to prepare individual management plans for as many estuaries as possible. The first draft revision of the Berg River Estuarine Management Plan (EMP), including the Situation Assessment and the Management Plan itself, is in response to a review conducted by the National Department of Environmental Affairs: Oceans and Coasts in 2014, to ensure compliance with the minimum requirements for estuary management plans as per the Protocol. This plan assigns roles and responsibilities to all organisations that are tasked with management of the Estuary.

The Responsible Management Authority (RMA) for the Berg River Estuary is mentioned as CapeNature according to the Groot Berg River Estuary Draft Estuarine Management Plan, August 2021: ‘’Coordination of the implementation of the actions in this EMP by the RMA, CapeNature, and its strategic partners (Berg River Local Municipality, Saldanha Bay Local Municipality, Department of Environmental Affairs, West Coast District Municipality, Western Cape Provincial Government, Department of Water and Sanitation, Department of Forestry and Fisheries), will be monitored by a Groot Berg Estuary (Advisory) Forum (BEAF) comprising all key stakeholders on the estuary, using indicators within a set time-frame.’’

The Bergrivier Municipality: By-law Relating to the Control of Vessels and Boating activities on the Berg River Estuary was adopted by Council on 29 September 2020. Bergrivier Municipality: By-law Relating to the Control of Vessels and Boating activities on the Berg River Estuary promulgated in the Provincial Gazette Extraordinary, no. 8338 on 23 October 2020, and is being reviewed.

National Estuary Management Protocol was promulgated in June 2021 and indicates: ‘’Where an estuary falls within the boundary of a Municipality, the Provincial Environmental Department must develop an EMP in consultation with affected municipalities and the relevant National Government Departments.’’
