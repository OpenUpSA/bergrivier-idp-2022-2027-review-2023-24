# Strategic Goal 2: Ensure good governance

## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1: CREATE AND EFFICIENT, EFFECTIVE, ECONOMIC AND ACCOUNTABLE ADMINISTRATION.

A well-managed and resourced institution is the foundation of good service delivery and there needs to be adequate office space, human resource capacity, equipment, fleet and technology to enable the municipality to provide quality value for money services and high standards of customer care.

THE MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

1. **Administrative and Committee Systems**

The municipality is focused on improving the effectiveness of the Record and Archives Services, Committees and Secretarial Services and the cleaning services by amending, adjusting and reviewing policies and procedures against departmental, statutory and audit guidelines.

The aim is to align technology, employees and the municipality’s functions for purposes of improving operational efficiency. Office automation in the sense of upgrading and enhancing computer hardware- and software used to digitally create, collect, store, and relay office information needed for accomplishing basic tasks on a continual basis is essential.

The creation of an efficient, effective, economic and accountable administration with a customer centred approach is of the utmost importance.

2. **Information technology communication systems**

The Municipality took a strategic decision to integrate various disparate ICT systems and established a corporate GIS system. The current systems will be used to achieve an integrated Enterprise Resource Programme (ERP) like system by expanding and decreasing those systems.

Implementation of the necessary Enterprise Resource Planning and continuous optimization of ICT assets, resources and capabilities are critical to the successful integration of the various disparate ICT systems. Effective change management are necessary in order to ensure improved productivity and profitability. It would also reduce resistance and improve communication with regards to the inherent challenges associated with major change.

Internationally accepted good governance practices dictates that ICT should be governed at all levels within an organizational structure. Accountability within the context of the operational environment of a municipality ensures alignment of ICT services and functions with the IDP and strategic goals set for the municipality. Decision making process in relation to ICT related investments and operational efficiency of the ICT environments must remain transparent and be upheld. It is therefore important that governance functions should incorporate the Corporate Governance of ICT. Corporate Governance of ICT is a continuous function which should make provision for necessary strategies, architectures, plans, frameworks, policies, structures, procedures, processes, mechanisms and controls with a view to ensure high levels of functionality, compliance and service delivery.

## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2: PROVIDE A TRANSPARENT AND CORRUPTION FREE MUNICIPALITY.

The Municipality will strive to improve its governance and accountability, by ensuring that the necessary systems and structures are in place.

6. INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT PLANNING

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

* Improve integration of municipal planning processes: The municipality needs to integrate planning processes more closely, especially the IDP, budget and performance management system. A framework was developed to refine the IDP processes and budget alignment which is currently being implemented. The newly draft TL SDBIP will also have to be based on the strategic goals and strategic objectives as outlined in the IDP;

## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3: ACCOUNTABLE LEADERSHIP SUPPORTED BY PROFESSIONAL AND SKILLED ADMINISTRATION.

**INTRODUCTION**

Value-driven leadership linked with resilience, mindfulness and emotional intelligence are characteristics and skills that are non-negotiable for leaders in Local Government today. High-impact leaders can survive in a very difficult sector where change is in the order of the day and huge challenges are normal. In the Western Cape we had the 7-year drought, and we learnt that if we stand together and really stretch ourselves, we can survive. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic and we took what we have learnt from surviving the drought and applied it to surviving and thriving under very difficult circumstances. And then came Eskom and loadshedding stages 1 – 8 making delivering basic services to the public nearly impossible.

**CHALLENGES**

The main challenges in building an accountable, professional and skilled administration are over-regulation, the Upper Limits imposed on Senior Managers, the fact that we can only select and recruit from a small body of professionals having done the specific minimum competencies for Local Government, and the non- professional nature of the administration in Local Government. The staff is also subject to burn-out and post Covid symptoms (having to deliver a wide range of unfunded and unmandated services on behalf of the State since 2020.

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

1. The Professionalization of Local Government’s Administration and Elected Councillors;
2. The re-design of the financial model on which local government is based;
3. The broadening of the selection and recruitment pool to be able to attract skilled people from other sectors; and
4. The redress of the Upper Limits to bring it in line with the rest of the staff working in Local Government reporting to Senior Management.

## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 4: COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PUBLIC.

1. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

* The municipality will improve the stakeholder management through the continuous identification of key stakeholders, and sectors and the updating of the stakeholder data base.
* The municipality will also review the stakeholder participation forums, with a view to making it more inclusive and effective (On-going).
* The municipality will continue the process of engaging individually with the 14 sectors identified within the municipality through the newly elected ward committees (On-going).

2. WARD COMMITTEES

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

Ward Committee development: The Ward Committees were elected in February 2022 and inducted and trained in March 2022. The ward committees have also been directly involved in the prioritisation of community needs and identification of projects to address some of these needs during their term of office. The Department of Strategic Services also needs to ensure that there is sufficient administrative support to the Ward Committees to perform their duties.

3. COMMUNICATION

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

The Municipality’s Communication Unit will prioritise its resources on further developing its internal and external communications platforms. Internally, the focus will be on improving inter-departmental planning which includes the development of a Standard Operating Procedure for communication flow within the organisation. The various Directorates will be encouraged and assisted to furnish the Communications Unit with all the relevant information it requires timeously, to perform its functions optimally. Externally, resources will be utilised to drive digital communications through the expansion of its social media offerings and also assisting ICT to improve the user-friendliness of the municipal website, and regularly updating the content on the platform.

Loud hailing also remains a powerful communications tool within the Bergrivier Municipal Area, to broadcast important messages with immediacy to the public.

The Communications Unit aims to develop more multimedia content for its TV Screens at all the reception desks at the various municipal offices, to provide clients with up-to-date content of a wide array of municipal services and news.

## STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 5: A CUSTOMER CENTRED APPROACH TO EVERYTHING WE DO.

**INTRODUCTION**

The municipality will endeavour to improve client services and will review the Customer Care Charter. A Client Services Survey is done annually to measure compliance with the standards contained in the charter. The municipality will also focus on the management and resolution of complaints (on-going).

* Ensuring service quality and efficiency;&#x20;

* Human Resource shortage;&#x20;
* Language barriers;&#x20;

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**
