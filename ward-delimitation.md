# Ward Delimitation

The ward demarcation of Bergrivier Municipality was changed for the 2016 municipal election in accordance with the Local Government Municipal Demarcation Act, 1998 (Act 27 of 1998) (Demarcation Act) and was demarcated into 7 (seven) wards. Although the Municipality had 7 wards prior to this, the new demarcation brought about significant changes which impact on municipal planning, information management and community participation practices. The following is a table outlining the new ward demarcation in comparison to the former demarcation:
